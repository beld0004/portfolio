## Description

Portfolio project made with lots of love and tears to improve visibility in the field.


# Explanations

Tell us about your process.

- [When I first started my portfolio, I had to look for modern inspirations that will make me achieve my goals. I liked the idea of a single scroll webpage for easy user interface access. With Accessibilities I put alt tags so that if the image does not load, they can see the description of image. I also used the HTML hierarcys. I also used Media Queries for Phones,Tablets and Web.]

Challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those change. 

- [Learning and using other technologies such as google fonts. I did not know a lot of the technologies and I had to throughly search Google and Youtube. As well as review previous school term to incorporate fonts and such. I also planned to put a video on the banner (an mp4 file) however I could not stage, commit pull and push my portfolio as it exceeded over 100MB. Therefore I had to delete the repository, make a new one, transfer the files I did to a new folder, then created another repo, forked it and then transferred my files unto the new repo. This solution allowed me to finally stage, commit, pull and push my project.]

What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?

- [What I learned is that it takes a bit of time to fully utilize code and not break it. Creating code from scratch definitely takes weeks, if not more.]

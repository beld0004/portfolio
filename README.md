# Explanations

Tell us about your process.

- [When I first started my portfolio, I had to look for modern inspirations that will make me achieve my goals. I liked the idea of a single scroll webpage for easy user interface access. With Accessibilities I put alt tags so that if the image does not load, they can see the description of image. I also used the HTML hierarcys. I also used Media Queries for Phones,Tablets and Web.]

Challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those change. 

- [Learning and using other technologies such as google fonts. I did not know a lot of the technologies and I had to throughly search Google and Youtube. As well as review previous school term to incorporate fonts and such.]

What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
